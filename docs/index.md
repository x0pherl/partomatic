# The Partomatic philosophy behind Fender-Bender

Build123d is a powerful library, but it leaves the creation of final parts up to the developer. For a project like fender-bender, with many related and interlocking parts, this can make releasing a new version a project in and of itself.

[Partomatic](https://github.com/x0pherl/fender-bender/blob/main/src/partomatic.py) enables _parametric modeling_ and standardizes some `build automation` for a part.

## Parametric Modeling
Parametric 3D modeling is a method of creating 3D models where the geometry is defined by parameters, allowing for easy adjustment by simply changing the values of these parameters. This approach enables the creation of flexible and reusable designs that can be quickly adapted to different requirements.
